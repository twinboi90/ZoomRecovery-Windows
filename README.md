# ZoomRecover-Windows

**Fix Zoom Error 1132 or avoid fingerprinting by running Zoom in a sandboxed Windows environment.**

This project provides a PowerShell-based utility to isolate Zoom under a separate local Windows user account (`ZoomLocal`) that runs Zoom independently of your main profile. This is useful if you've been shadow-banned or locked out of meetings due to persistent Zoom fingerprinting.
